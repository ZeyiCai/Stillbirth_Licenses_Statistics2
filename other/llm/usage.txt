Here is the R code to generate line plot, bar plot, scatter plot, and box plot based on the CSV file you provided:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("path_to_your_csv_file.csv")

# Convert TIME_PERIOD to Date format
data$TIME_PERIOD <- as.Date(paste(data$TIME_PERIOD, "01", sep = "-"), format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Line Plot: Trend of Stillbirth Licenses over Time by Civic Centre
ggplot(data, aes(x = TIME_PERIOD, y = STILLBIRTH_LICENSES, color = CIVIC_CENTRE)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Trend of Stillbirth Licenses Across Civic Centres", 
       x = "Time Period", y = "Number of Stillbirth Licenses") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Bar Plot: Total Stillbirth Licenses by Civic Centre
ggplot(data, aes(x = CIVIC_CENTRE, y = STILLBIRTH_LICENSES, fill = CIVIC_CENTRE)) +
  stat_summary(fun = sum, geom = "bar") +
  labs(title = "Total Stillbirth Licenses by Civic Centre", 
       x = "Civic Centre", y = "Total Stillbirth Licenses") +
  theme_minimal()

# Scatter Plot: Distribution of Stillbirth Licenses Over Time
ggplot(data, aes(x = TIME_PERIOD, y = STILLBIRTH_LICENSES, color = CIVIC_CENTRE)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Stillbirth Licenses Over Time", 
       x = "Time Period", y = "Stillbirth Licenses") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Box Plot: Distribution of Stillbirth Licenses by Civic Centre
ggplot(data, aes(x = CIVIC_CENTRE, y = STILLBIRTH_LICENSES, fill = CIVIC_CENTRE)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Stillbirth Licenses by Civic Centre", 
       x = "Civic Centre", y = "Stillbirth Licenses") +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:
Line Plot: Shows the trend of stillbirth licenses over time for each civic center.
Bar Plot: Displays the total number of stillbirth licenses issued by each civic center.
Scatter Plot: Represents the distribution of stillbirth licenses over time.
Box Plot: Shows the distribution of stillbirth licenses by civic center.
You can replace "path_to_your_csv_file.csv" with the actual path to your CSV file and run this code to generate the plots. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

Let’s break down and analyze the dataset based on the columns available: CIVIC_CENTRE, STILLBIRTH_LICENSES, and TIME_PERIOD.

1. Descriptive Statistics:
Number of Civic Centers: We can find how many unique civic centers are in the dataset and analyze the distribution of stillbirth licenses for each.
Range of Time Period: The dataset provides monthly data. We can determine the range of time covered.
Stillbirth Licenses Statistics: We'll compute basic statistics (mean, median, max, etc.) for the stillbirth licenses across the entire dataset and for each civic center.
2. Trend Analysis:
Time Trend for Stillbirth Licenses: Identify if there are any obvious trends or seasonal variations in the number of licenses issued over time.
Civic Center Comparison: Compare the different civic centers to see if certain centers consistently issue more licenses than others.
3. Distribution Analysis:
Overall Distribution of Stillbirth Licenses: Analyze the spread and distribution (e.g., skewness, kurtosis) of the stillbirth licenses across the dataset.
Outliers: Check if there are any extreme values in the number of stillbirth licenses for any civic centers.
Let me perform these steps and give you insights. I’ll begin by calculating some descriptive statistics and visualizing key trends in the data.

Civic Centre Stillbirth Statistics


Analysis of the Data:
Descriptive Statistics for Stillbirth Licenses:
Mean: The average number of stillbirth licenses issued per month across all civic centers is approximately 63.
Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is around 55.79, indicating variability in the data.
Minimum: The lowest number of licenses issued in a month is 1.
Maximum: The highest number of licenses issued in a month is 533.
Median (50th Percentile): The median is 54, meaning half of the months had fewer than 54 licenses and half had more.
Civic Centers:
There are 4 unique civic centers in the dataset.
Time Range:
The data spans from January 2011 to July 2024.
Civic Center Insights:
I have provided a detailed table of stillbirth license statistics for each civic center, including the total, average, and maximum licenses issued. You can review this to see how the civic centers compare in terms of licenses issued.
Next Steps:
Based on this initial analysis, we could further explore:

Time Series Trends: To see if there are any long-term trends, seasonality, or irregularities.
Outliers: The maximum value of 533 might indicate an outlier, which could be further investigated.
